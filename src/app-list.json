Users & communities can pool, fractionalize and borrow against their illiquid NFTs in order to\n- Unlock liquidity instantly\n- Generate sustainable yields\n- Empower their communities\n\n# Our products \n\n**Loans  - Borrow from the protocol using your NFTs or pool tokens as collateral**\n\nUsers can get $SOL liquidity using their NFTs or pool tokens as collateral. 50% of the fees generated from the borrowing product will be shared to the associated projects or DAO. Becoming a whitelisted borrowing collection on the Frakt protocol is therefore another great way to unlock an additional revenue source for your project or DAO \n\n**Lending - Deposit SOL into the lending liquidity pools to earn the interest paid by the borrowers**\n\n**Pools - Buy, sell and swap NFTs instantly**\n\nUsers can add their NFTs into a collection specific NFT Pool to receive the associated fungible pool tokens in exchange for their contribution to the pool. Pool tokens can then be instantly swapped for $SOL or $USDC liquidity, or used to redeem specific/random NFTs from the pool. Users can therefore buy, sell and swap NFTs instantly. This product is targeted at floor price NFTs. As a project or DAO, creating a liquid NFT Pool for your collection will create market arbitrage opportunities bringing an overall higher volume for the collection therefore generating both pool fees and higher marketplace royalties. Pool & Marketplaces are therefore complementary\n\n**Liquidity & Inventory Staking - Stake pool tokens to earn the fees generated by the pools**\n\nUsers and communities can stake their pool tokens to earn 80% of the fees generated by each interaction with the pool. For projects and DAOs owning floor NFTs, providing some of their inventory to the pool and becoming the initial liquidity provider is a great way to unlock an additional revenue source\n\n**Vaults  - Fractionalize single or multiple NFTs (baskets) and trade them**\n\nUsers and communities can fractionalize single or multiple NFTs (NFT Baskets) into fungible fraktions. A vault is the entity that locks the NFT, issues the tokens linked to the fraktionalization and manages the buyout process. Fraktions can then be sold, distributed to communities or provided as liquidity to earn trading fees. This product is targeted at expensive/rare NFTs & collections\n\n**Guard - Initial Liquidity Offering protocol for NFT collection aimed to prevents rugs**\n\nNew NFT collections to be minted and Launchpads can use our ‚ÄúInitial Liquidity Offering‚Äù (ILO) solution in order to ensure post mint liquidity, therefore preventing rugs and making teams more accountable. Part of the SOL raised during the mint is automatically added and locked as $TOKEN/$SOL pool liquidity.

Every user‚Äôs tokens are first held in a pool controlled by the Lido program.\n\nThe Lido program collects the deposited SOL and releases the newly minted stSOL to the user. Beneath the layer, the Lido Program will distribute this SOL uniformly across those validators that are participating. When these delegations accrue rewards on the allotted stake, the total SOL under management increases and this increases the value of stSOL tokens.

You can withdraw your SOL at any time by unstaking and waiting for the unlock period (1-2 epochs) or immediately with a small fee (see our [FAQ](https://docs.marinade.finance/faq/faq). You can also directly exchange between mSOL and SOL on secondary markets at the current rate. \n\n# What are the benefits of staking SOL?\n\nBlockchains use consensus protocols in order to validate transactions in a secure and decentralized way.

But unlike anything else, it‚Äôs asset and protocol agnostic. Everything in the wallet is an xNFT. This is a big deal. Most wallets only show your tokens. Some don‚Äôt even show your precious JPEGs. \n\nBackpack, however, is a home for everything. It‚Äôs an open, programmable system built for Web3. And like any other application operating system, has a set of developer frameworks and APIs associated with it, allowing anyone to build their own xNFT apps for any protocol on any blockchain‚Äîwithout permission.\n\nThis is a lot, and believe it or not, this is just the beginning. There‚Äôs a lot more on our roadmap that we can‚Äôt wait to share. We‚Äôre nurturing a vibrant ecosystem of xNFTs, so if you‚Äôre building in crypto, reach out. Let‚Äôs build together.\n\nWAO.\n\nSo WTF are xNFTs?\n\nWell, they‚Äôre just apps, but the story doesn‚Äôt end here.
