Jungle Finance is a Defi primitive protocol built on the Solana blockchain, allowing users to create, buy, sell and redeem their staking or farm rewards instantaneously. SPL Tokens can be deposited into Jungle auto-compounding vaults in exchange for two separate tokens; one which represents ownership of the staking or farm rewards generated over a set period of time and the other representing ownership of the base asset minus the rewards. 

The reward tokens (I-TOKENS) may be bought or sold up front, whether to speculate on yields increasing or decreasing, or as a method of increasing capital efficiency by allowing immediate access to future yield. These tokens are essentially yield futures on supported assets. 

Base asset tokens (J-TOKENS) may be used to speculate on asset price, as collateral for loans or synthetic assets and a great number of additional potential use-cases which we invite the Solana DeFi community to aid and compete with us in building.

All features of the Jungle Finance platform are facilitated by the JFI token, which is a governance token designed to grant holders the ability in the future to vote on supported assets, pools, farm rewards, treasury allocation, partnerships and feature implementation.
