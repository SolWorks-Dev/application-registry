Sujiko is derivatives protocol focused on enabling on-chain perps for highly liquid NFT collections. Sujiko enables users to a) short NFTs and b) speculate on high-value NFTs that are too expensive for retail.

We’ve implemented a asset class agnostic framework that enables support for different asset classes (enabling us to expand to crypto, forex, etc).


It allows users to take directional positions, akin to Binance perps, through 3 different liquidity mechanisms: a global vAMM, a decentralized orderbook and an auction mechanism for market orders.

**Perps are hard.** That’s before adding 400ms+ latency to every request and focusing on long-tail assets. The secret to Sujiko is in our approach to building a derivatives protocol, focusing on managing risk and tackling liquidity.
