Mango Markets is built on the Solana blockchain and utilises Serum DEX for spot margin trading while perpetual futures are traded on Mango Markets' own order book. Mango Markets is governed by MNGO token holders via the Mango DAO.

There are a number of ways to connect your trading system to the Mango Markets' on-chain programme. The easiest way for traders who are used to centralised exchanges, is to use the REST & WebSocket API that was purposefully designed to be easy to integrate. If you want to have the highest level of control, you will most likely want to communicate directly with the blockchain using one of the existing open source wrappers for TypeScript, Python or .NET."""
