long = "Chainlink is a decentralized oracle network that currently provides decentralization at both the oracle and data source level. By using multiple independent Chainlink nodes, the user can defend against one oracle being a single point of failure. Similarly, using multiple data sources for sourcing market prices, the user can defend against one data source being a single source of truth."
