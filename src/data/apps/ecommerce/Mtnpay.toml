mtnPay is the Solana API for payment companies.

[mtnAPI](https://mtnpay.gitbook.io/api-docs/) enforces a standard for NFT and DeFi integration into payments and commerce.

Our infrastructure composes on-chain transactions to unlock tailored commerce experiences on the Solana settlement layer.

We seek to power the “Pay with Solana” button.

## Features
📱**SPL and Solana Token Payments**
Enables payments when both parties want to use a specified SPL token as payment

🔄 **Token Swapped Payments**
We leverage [Jupiter](https://jup.ag/) so merchants can accept token agnostic payments

🤳🏻**‘Headless’ NFT Minting**
Enables a “headless mint” via a QR code or through a wallet redirect link using [Metaplex](https://www.metaplex.com/)

📴 **NFT & SFT Discounts**
Payment Discount enables a discount if the user owns an NFT from a specified collection

📸 **NFT Photobooth**
Booth is an iPad app that provides a photo booth experience via mtnAPI endpoints 

✔️ **NFT & SFT Verification**
Enables verification to see if the purchaser is holding an NFT from a specified collection
