long = """In the beginning of the 23rd Century, 95% of Earth’s human population was wiped out by unrelenting showers of acidic rain pouring for years on end. Having predicted the Flooding, a group of scientists had created a collection of robots to immortalize the legacy of man. 

After over a hundred years of cryogenic slumber, the scientists wake up to a society rebuilt by the combined efforts of man and machine. But then, along the way, something went terribly wrong… Welcome to Solana, a dystopian society ravaged by mafia and infectious mutations, where dog eats dog and climbing the social ladder requires the unimaginable."""
