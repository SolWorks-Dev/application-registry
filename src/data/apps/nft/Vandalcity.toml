**HOME**
Vandal City, the home of multi-millionaires hiding away in their skyscraper homes and private estates, is being taken over by a band of bandits & bank robbers.

**BACKGROUND**
Vandals have entered Vandal City with a particular set of skills that they're ready to put to the test. They use $VAULT token to crack the codes of the multi-millionaires bank vaults and take what they deserve. They have been preparing for this moment in the shadows for years, and now they're ready to unlock the $VAULT.

**Mission**
Vandal City is a lifestyle and your $VAULT is yours. We believe that the blockchain and NFT community is place for collaborative games, where alone the job can be hard but with some help anything is possible. Crew up, find the code, share the rewards.
