BONK is the first Solana dog coin for the people, by the people with 50% of the total supply airdropped to the Solana community. The Bonk contributors were tired of toxic “Alameda” tokenomics and wanted to make a fun memecoin where everyone gets a fair shot. 

We aim to bring back liquidity to Solana DEXes, alongside Openbook's launch, in an initiative we like to call, OPENBONK!

The 50% airdrop will be split as follows:
- 20% to Solana NFT collections, comprising of 297,000 individual NFTs
- 15% to early Openbook traders
- 10% to Solana artists & collectors
- 5% to Solana developers

For full details please see the [BONKPAPER](https://www.bonkcoin.com/bonkpaper).
