Tensor is the fastest, meanest and most feature-rich NFT trading venue, designed for pros. 😎

## Real time, down to the second data 🏎

- Onchain activities take just 2-3s to appear in the UI
- The UI updates itself, you never have to refresh the page
- Changing collections takes 1 click, and loads all data instantly

## Trade ALL (10,000+) collections on Solana

- From the get go we support trading for ALL 10,000+ collections on Solana
- We're running some filters to remove the sketchy ones, but other than that you should be able to trade anything under the sun

## Instant new mints + instant metadata + instant rarities 💎

- New collections / mints are added instantly, as soon as they hit the [@metaplex](https://twitter.com/metaplex) contract
- Whenever metadata updates, we refresh it automatically
- All new mints are automatically rarity-scored

We're fully integrated with [@howrareis]() - so for mature collections not only do you get automatic ranks by Tensor, but you also get their official rankings ✨

## Multi-marketplace 🪄

We aggregate listings & route orders to 6 largest marketplaces on Solana - [@magiceden](https://twitter.com/MagicEden), [@YawwwNFT](https://twitter.com/YawwwNFT), [@opensea](https://twitter.com/opensea), [@SolanartNFT](https://twitter.com/SolanartNFT), [@coralcubenft](https://twitter.com/coralcubenft) and [@fractalwagmi](https://twitter.com/fractalwagmi).
 
Think about it: with a single click you can place 3 bids on ME, 2 on Yawww and 1 on CoralCube! 🤯

## Bulk actions - and not just sweeps 🧹

Yeah sweeping 10 NFTs at a time is cool - but you know what's even cooler? 

Placing 100 bids. Or cancelling 100. Or Listing 100 NFTs. Or delisting all of them.

With 1 click of a button.

## Advanced filtering options 🧐

- Only want to see Alien SMBs? 👽 
- Or only PornStache DeGods? 🧔‍♀️ 
- Or only top 100 by rarity? 💎

We got you. Filter by trait, by trait count, by price, and by rarity rank!

## Most important data - at your fingertips 📊🖐

- Collection stats (floor price, listed/supply, trading volume)
- Floor price chart / TradingView
- Order Book / Sell Wall - how many selling at what price?
- Recent activities (listings, sales, etc) in a timeline feed

## Fully configurable UI ⚙️

We recognize that every trader is different and has a unique trading style.

That's why on Tensor you can twist & turn the layout to suit your needs.

## Historic trades & activities 📝

It's nice to be able to go back and see what you traded, at what price, and on which marketplace.

You. Got. It.

See ALL past actions (listings, delistings, sales, etc) across ALL marketplaces - in 1 place.

## NFT multi-sender 🚀

If you trade a lot of NFTs -- you probably send around a lot of NFTs.

We've built the simplest & fastest way to do that. 

1. Fire up your INVENTORY tab, 
2. choose collections/NFTs to send
3. Enter wallet & hit SEND
4. 💥
