Step Finance is the front page of Solana. Visualise, Analyse, Execute and Aggregate transactions across all Solana contracts in one place. Step is a portfolio management dashboard and transaction aggregator where users can monitor their tokens associated with their wallets, LP positions, Staked Yield farms, Margin positions and more.

Users of Step Finance can also execute Swaps and enter various yield farms and automated vaults from within Step with any fees on such value accrual services going back to STEP stakers.

Additional data tools for Solana are available on Step including detailed Transaction History and the Opportunities page, an easily filterable source of aggregate data for DEXs, lenders and margin trading platforms within the ecosystem. 

The recently launched Step Learn is intended to help those entering the Solana ecosystem better use our platform and highlight some of Step's unique features. Moving forward users can expect additional guides and sections to be added as we expand our educational guides throughout the Solana ecosystem.

Step publishes a free biweekly Data Insights newsletter covering trends within the space on topics ranging from DeFi and detailed DEX analysis to NFTs and NFT marketplaces.
