Hubble Protocol is a stablecoin borrowing platform. Hubble allows users to deposit a variety of crypto assets as collateral, and borrow USDH in return. USDH is thus fully overcollateralized by crypto assets. The protocol offers a full loan-management suite, so users can keep track of their collateral value and loan-to-value ratio, as well as manage their loans by depositing/borrowing more collateral, or USDH. 

Hubble is actively onboarding more collateral assets, as well as establishing partnerships across Solana to expand USDH use-cases.
