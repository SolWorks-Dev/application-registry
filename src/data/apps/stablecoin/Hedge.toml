Hedge is a protocol that enables the minting of USH, a stablecoin soft-pegged to the US dollar. USH is minted on flexible terms and gives users instant access to the USH ecosystem.

Hedge allows users to take out 0% interest loans for a one-time fee by depositing collateral for USH. Users are incentivized to keep their collateral-to-debt ratio above 110% to avoid liquidation. When an undercollateralized vault is liquidated, users who have deposited USH in a stability pool are returned discounted collateral as a reward. USH is always redeemable for its underlying value, but a fee ensures the protocol is impacted infrequently.
