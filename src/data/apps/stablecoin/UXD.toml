UXD Protocol is a fully collateralized decentralized stablecoin backed by delta-neutral position using derivatives.

UXD is a next-generation decentralized stablecoin that integrates with top derivative trading exchanges on Solana in order to create a "delta-neutral" position that collateralizes the stablecoin. Our first derivative dex will be mango markets. Through UXD's construct, we are able to solve the "stablecoin trilemma", allowing UXD to be stable, capital efficient, and decentralized. Moreover, the stablecoin has native yield from the "funding rate" of the perpetual futures position it puts on, allowing UXD stakeholders to generate yield as a result. 

See [UXD Basics](https://docs.uxd.fi/uxdprotocol/overview/uxd-basics) for an explanation of concepts like Derivatives, Delta, Perpetual Futures, Funding Rates, etc.
