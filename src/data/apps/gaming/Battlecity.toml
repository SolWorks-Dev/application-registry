BattleCity.io brings blockchain technology to: (1) build a sustainable ecosystem (BattleCity.io’s ecosystem) to support game-builders (include game studios or individual game developers) transform their games into GameFi projects, and, (2) provide an NFT Marketplace (BattleCity.io Marketplace) to support game-players to be able to play and earn via multiple WOL Games, participate and trade NFTs in player-owned economies via network governance and consensus. 

In short, here are the following highlights of WOL Games listed on Metaverse of BattleCity.io for everyone’s reference: Play To Earn (P2E). Player vs Player (PvP). Team vs Team. The winner takes it all (W2E). WOL NFT on demand (Mint your NFT assets when you want). Profit-sharing for WOL Holders keeping at least 500.000 WOL Tokens for at least 45 (forty-five) consecutive days. (WOL HOLD policy)."""
